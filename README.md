# About Me
Hello! I am Dominic Sutton, a Software Developer who has recently graduated from Grand Canyon University and is looking to get his career started. Here I have posted my most 
recent work from my last semester of GCU. While the vast majority of the work displayed here is in C# this is my most recent work and best showcases what I am capable of. 
I am also well versed in Java and PhP with the intention of broadening my skills and incorporating other languages.
